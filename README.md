# Cristotheme
A variant on the existing SolarisTheme and DeepBlueTheme Aurora 4x Mods

A mod that modifies the SolarisTheme mod by simast https://github.com/simast/SolarisTheme/blob/master/SolarisTheme.cs using some of the changes from the DeepBlueTheme mod by Jorgen_CAB https://aurora2.pentarch.org/index.php?topic=12593.0.

Both of these are built on the back of twitce2double's ThemeCreator https://github.com/Aurora-Modders/ThemeCreator

And all of the above is actually applied using 01010100b's AuroraPatch: https://github.com/Aurora-Modders/AuroraPatch

Vast majority of credit rightly goes to those people, thank you!

USAGE (including aurora and auroura patch install) 

1- Download Aurora 4x 1.13 http://aurora2.pentarch.org/index.php?topic=10635.0
You many need to right click "open in new tab" the download link on certain versions of chrome - or try another browser entierly. 
This step gives you a compressed file, create a folder (I call mine "Aurora - [version I'm installing]") and extract the contense of the downloaded file into there.
This file is now your Aurora file, and unless spesified all below instructions to "overwrite base" or similar mean put the files into this file. 

2- Download and apply Aurora 4x 2.5.0 patch https://aurora2.pentarch.org/index.php?topic=13418.0
By "apply" here I mean overwrite the base aurora files with these new files.

3- Download and apply Aurora 4x 2.5.1 patch https://aurora2.pentarch.org/index.php?topic=13462.0
By "apply" here I mean overwrite the base aurora files with these new files.

4- Download Aurora Patch - then follow instructions here to install it: https://github.com/Aurora-Modders/AuroraPatch
Note that you are not attempting to download the code from the repository - you want just the zip file from the releases page here: https://github.com/Aurora-Modders/AuroraPatch/releases 
Overwrite the bases aroura with the contense of this zip just as above. 

5- Download this repository "code > download zip" 

6- Copy the contents of the Patches file from the repository code into your Patches file (the one that should already exist after step 4 - if it doesn't read step 4 carefully and try again)

7- Run the game by running the "AuroraPatch" EXE file - not the normal "Aurora" EXE

Enjoy! 



NOTE  you may not be able to access the forum on your browser, the website security certificate is expired, this doens't really matter (unless you use login details on there that you use elsewhere DON'T DO THAT EVER YOU SPANNER)
In order to load the page remove the "s" from the "https" in the URL - if your browser (IE chrome) doesn't let you do that then use firefox instead. 

NOTE 2 - don't ever report bugs on the forum while using this (or any other mod). 
NOTE 3 - you must use a "." decimel seperator for Aurora to work - not a "," as is commen in some countries - google how to change that if you need to. 
NOTE 4 - overwriting the files usually works, if you want to be more cautious it's recomended that instead you delete the files that are to be overwritten and then bring in the new versions.
