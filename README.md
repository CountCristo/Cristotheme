# Cristotheme
A variant on the existing SolarisTheme and DeepBlueTheme Aurora 4x Mods


# USAGE (including Aurora and Aurora patch install)

1. Download [Aurora 4x 1.13](http://aurora2.pentarch.org/index.php?topic=10635.0) <br>
This step gives you a compressed file, create a folder (I call mine "Aurora - [ENTER YOUR INSTALLED VERSION]") and extract the contents of the downloaded file into there. <br>
This file is now your Aurora installation directory. Unless specified otherwise, the following instructions that mention 'overwriting base' or similar actions refer to placing the downloaded files into this directory.

1. Download and apply [Aurora 4x 2.7.0](https://aurora2.pentarch.org/index.php?topic=13866.0) patch <br>
By "apply" here I mean overwriting the base aurora files with these new files.

1. Download and apply [Aurora 4x 2.7.1](https://aurora2.pentarch.org/index.php?topic=13883.0) patch. Ensure it overwrites the existing files from the 2.5.0 patch as well.

2. Download Aurora Patch from it's [release](https://github.com/Aurora-Modders/AuroraPatch/releases) page. <br>
Extract the files and apply them on your Aurora game directory.

1. Download this repository "code > download zip"

2. Copy the contents of the downloaded zip folder from the repository code into the game directory of Aurora.

3. Run the game by running the "**AuroraPatch**" EXE file - not the normal "Aurora" EXE. <br>
Be sure to select the Cristotheme.


## NOTES

1. You may not be able to access the forum on your browser because the website's security certificate is expired. However, this doesn't necessarily matter (*unless you use login details on there that you use elsewhere **DON'T DO THAT EVER YOU SPANNER***) <br>
In order to load the page remove the "*s*" from the "*https*" in the URL - if your browser (i.e *IE chrome*) doesn't let you do that then use firefox instead.

2. Don't ever report bugs on the forum while using this (or any other mod)

3. Aurora requires a period (.) as the decimal separator to function correctly. Some countries use a comma (,) for decimals, so be sure to adjust your system settings if necessary.
4. Overwriting the files usually works, if you want to be more cautious it's recomended that instead you delete the files that are to be overwritten and then bring in the new versions.

# Credits
A mod that modifies the [SolarisTheme mod](https://github.com/simast/SolarisTheme/blob/master/SolarisTheme.cs) by simast using some of the changes from the [DeepBlueTheme mod](https://aurora2.pentarch.org/index.php?topic=12593.0) by Jorgen_CAB.

Both of these are built on the back of twitce2double's [ThemeCreator](https://github.com/Aurora-Modders/ThemeCreator)

And all of the above is actually applied using 01010100b's [AuroraPatch](https://github.com/Aurora-Modders/AuroraPatch).

Vast majority of credit rightly goes to those people, thank you!
