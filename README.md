# Cristotheme
A variant on the existing SolarisTheme and DeepBlueTheme Aurora 4x Mods

A mod that modifies the SolarisTheme mod by simast https://github.com/simast/SolarisTheme/blob/master/SolarisTheme.cs using some of the changes from the DeepBlueTheme mod by Jorgen_CAB https://aurora2.pentarch.org/index.php?topic=12593.0.

Both of these are built on the back of twitce2double's ThemeCreator https://github.com/Aurora-Modders/ThemeCreator
